# ARTIK Cloud Proxy Hub
ARTIK Cloud Proxy Hub application is a hub that can link to ARTIK Cloud multiple devices present in your area.

ARTIK Cloud Proxy Hub is already compatible with multiple devices (Wemo, Shell command...) but you can extend it adding some new proxies that are able to talk to new devices.

# Setup
- In order to setup your Proxy hub we recommend you to use a fix IP
- Required NodeJS: node and npm, https://nodejs.org/en/
- Unzip the ARTIKCloudProxyHub.zip
- Go to the ARTIKCloudProxyHub folder
- Run "npm install" (can take up to 1h on a slow computer)
- Then run "npm start"
- After the server is started you will be able to read this line:
"GO TO THIS WEBPAGE TO ACCESS THE UI: <url>"
- Open a browser and go to the url.
- The ui will guide you to set up you proxy hub.

#Restart the server
- If you stop the server you can restart it using "npm start"

# How to add a new proxy to ARTIK Cloud Proxy Hub
To add a new proxy add his folder to the `/proxies` folder.
Proxies with a folder starting with '_' are not loaded.
_template folder contains an example of what you need to do to create a proxy

# To develop on the ui (not available on through the release zip)
- First install the ui by runing "npm run installui"
- You can switch to a dev version of the ui. Run "npm start:devui" to start the server on with a non minified ui.
- By running "npm run watchui", you can get auto-update on your js css and html files.
